# ThirdYearProject: LLL
This is RHUL Computer Science Third Year Project in topic of LLL Algorithm.

In this project, an python application is built to implement LLL.

To have a understanding to LLL algorithm, you may have a backgound reading in:
* [Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm)
* [Factoring Polynomials with Rational Coefficients](https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~hwl/PUBLICATIONS/1982f/art.pdf)

## Requirement

This project built with a python 3.6 environment, and a python package:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for numerical computations.

 Some python library may also needed:
* [py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) for testing Python.
* [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting.

You may also want:
* [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/index.html) to help running with application.

### Installing

Python 3.6
* Go to the [Download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of the [Python official website](https://www.python.org)
* Pick the right version that runs with your OS.
* After downloading the specific release, run the installation application and follow the guilds. 
* In the following instructions, pip is assumed to be installed, please follow the pip installation if not

Python pip
* Open the Python terminal
* Input command "pip --version" to check if pip installed
* Go to the Scripts folder located in the Python installation folder by using "cd" command
* Input command "easy_install.exe pip"

NumPy
* Go to the [Download page](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) of [NumPy official website](http://www.numpy.org/)
* Download the suitable version of NumPy accoundingly
* Drop the file under Scripts folder located in the Python installation folder

flake8
* Open the Python terminal
* Input command python -m pip install flake8

SageMath
* It is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL, which builds on top of many existing open-source packages.
* There is an online version and a download version of SgaeMath
* You may use it online in the website [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/), or follow the guild in [SageMath Download Page](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html)
